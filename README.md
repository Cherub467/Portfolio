# Portfolio
This is a collection of projects written by Lauren Mayes. Executible projects will have instuction on how to download and run them. Non-Executible projects need specific software or hardware to run, but will still contain the insrutions on how I ran them as well and pictures and videos of their execution. Projects in development are samples of code or designs for future projects.
