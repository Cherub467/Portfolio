Abstract: Anyone who has ever tried to learn a language is well aware that it can be a challenging and time-consuming process. However, with the help of modern technology, advancing past the beginner stages has become much simpler. Unfortunately, intermediate and advanced-level learners often lack the same level of technical support. Traditional learning paths such as tutoring or immersion can be expensive and inconvenient. In this paper we introduce LanguageBuddy, a language immersion tool that uses object and speech recognition with ChatGPT technology. LanguageBuddy is designed to provide conversational practice in self-directed learning sessions that simulate environments where the target language is dominant. With LanguageBuddy, users use their AR camera to turn their immediate surroundings into a virtual immersive environment. We use object recognition to create situationally relevant ChatGPT-generated prompts with related keywords. This allows users to practice speaking and reading in their target language. To facilitate learning, the system provides real-time translations that display both the spoken target language as well as the userâ€™s native language to help the user gauge the correctness of their speech. LanguageBuddy is a promising tool that can help bridge the language learning gap between the beginner and advanced stages, thereby making language learning more accessible to everyone.

Personal contribution: I was responsible for the ChatGPT integration, including contacting ChatGPT servers, generating prompts based on identified objects, and parsing the ChatGPT result to the UI.

Unfortunetly the project was unable to be compiled and run on the desired hardware so the Unity project was not exported. Additionally the ChatGPT key was stored loacally so the application could only be run on specific hardware. The system was a proof of concept and was not intended to be published.
