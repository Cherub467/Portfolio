Abstract: Traditional Graphical passwords tend to focus on either small gridbased systems or image recognition/differentiation. For grid-based passwords, much work has been done to analyze different types of strength on 3x3 and 4x4 grids, but little work has been done to generalize these conceptions of strength to larger and non-square grids. This paper aims to analyze existing metrics against larger grids and discusses if these are still meaningful measures.
